For predicting real estate prices, especially with a dataset that includes historical price changes for each apartment, we can leverage several machine learning models. The choice of the model can depend on the specifics of the dataset, the nature of the features, and the amount of data available. Here are a few models that would typically be most effective for this type of time series prediction problem:

1. **Linear Regression Models**:
   - **Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)**: Good for univariate time series forecasting where the prediction is based on past values.
   - **Vector Autoregression (VAR)**: Useful when you have multiple time series that influence each other.

2. **Tree-based Models**:
   - **Random Forests**: Can handle non-linear relationships and interactions between features well. They can be adapted to handle time series data by including lagged variables and rolling statistics.
   - **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)**: Such as XGBoost, LightGBM, or CatBoost, which can capture complex relationships in the data and are often very effective in practice.

3. **Neural Network Models**:
   - **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) or Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), which are specifically designed to handle sequential data and can capture long-term dependencies.
   - **Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs)**: These can also be effective for time series prediction, often with fewer training difficulties compared to RNNs.
   - **Transformer-based Models**: Such as the Temporal Fusion Transformer, which can handle multiple time series and incorporate static features well.

4. **Hybrid Models**:
   - Combining ARIMA with machine learning models (e.g., ARIMA with XGBoost or LSTM) to capture both linear and non-linear patterns in the data.

### Workflow
1.  **Model Selection**:
   - Start with simpler models like linear regression or ARIMA to establish a baseline.
   - Progress to more complex models like Random Forests, GBMs, and RNNs if the simpler models are insufficient.

2. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Use cross-validation techniques, particularly time series cross-validation, to ensure the model's robustness.
   - Evaluate models using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Use techniques like grid search or randomized search for hyperparameter optimization, especially for tree-based and neural network models.

4. **Model Interpretation and Validation**:
   - Ensure the model is interpretable and validate its predictions against known benchmarks or expert insights.

In practice, you might start with an ARIMA model to capture the basic time series patterns and then move to a Random Forest or GBM to capture non-linear relationships and interactions. For capturing more complex temporal dependencies, an LSTM or Transformer-based model might be employed.

Given the specifics of your dataset and requirements, a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of different models can often yield the best results.
