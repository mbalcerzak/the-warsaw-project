While building this project I encountered multitude of "challenges" and I describe them here along with chosen fixes.
There are some things I would do differently with the knowledge I have now but the project is good enough :heart:

# Problems with...

## ... the business problem
| :boom: Challenges| :fire: Solutions |
|:---------------| --------------- |
| Are people interested in what I'm buliding? | Even if it's only my own questions that I'm answering it's still worh building|


## ... gathering the data
| :boom: Challenges| :fire: Solutions |
|:---------------| --------------- |
| Is Raspberry Pi OK or should I use something like AWS Lambda? | Raspberry Pi is cheaper and does the job so far |
| Checking the price was too slow | Instead of checking the database itself (to see if the ad is already present) I query it in the beginning, load results to JSON and check this file. That also reduced the number of times teh database got locked beyond repair|
| I gathered more than 500k ads last year and there are only 2mln people in Warsaw | Database might contain duplicates and I will need to remove them during cleaning | 
| Power outages (and me moving flats) caused gaps in data | Â¯\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯ A cloud scraper would be more robust and reliable but I am not a millionare ðŸ’¸ | 

## ... database
| :boom: Challenges| :fire: Solutions |
|:---------------| --------------- |
| [SQLite]('https://www.sqlite.org/index.html') database keeps getting locked | Sometimes rebooting the Raspberry Pi worked, other times I had to use my weekly backup. Next time I would use Postgres (SQLite is perfect for student projects but this one grew out of it)|
| I chose the wrong Primary Key (8 last numbers from "ID" instead of the whole number)| Quick database migration solved it, replaced the old PK with the full "ad ID" number |
| How do I save the price history? | My first idea was to use _JSON {"date":YYYY-MM-DD, "price": XXX}_ but it introduced potential problems. Eventually, I created another table with prices. Connected to the flat table via ad ID. And that got it to [3rd Normal Form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization)  |


## ... price changes
| :boom: Challenges| :fire: Solutions |
|:---------------| --------------- |
|Some owners change the price daily by 1 PLN (0.2 EUR) just to make the ad more visible| Oh well... keep gathering the data, I will clean it after |
|Sometimes the price is actually a phone number or 200 PLN instead of 200k PLN| I will worry about it during data cleaning |
