## Business problem
---

The aim of this project is to build a model that would help me 
identify a good investment opportunity (overpriced or undervalued apartment in Valencia). 
The model would predict a price given the data and indicate whether the actual price 
is too high or too low. 

## [Gathering the data](/Data/1_data_scraping.md)
---

#### Built with:
- [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/)
- [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/)

#### Database:
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

#### Output API:
- JSON hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/mbalcerzak/Valencia_flats_api/tree/raspberry-updates/json_dir)

#### Scraper:
- on [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)
- using [Cron](https://crontab.guru/)
- from [idealista.com](https://www.idealista.com/)

#### Price changes
The script checks if the apartment is already present in the database and if yes, if the price has changed.


## Basic statistics
---
The average price for every month per every district of Valencia and apartment "category size" is calulated and output as REST API.
Data is (was) updated daily. The last update was performed in February 2022 due to no new advertisements being 
published on gumtree after the Ukraine War started.

Aggregated statistics include:
- average price per square metre durign each month, per district per size category
- daily number of posted advertisements
- number of price changes on a given day
