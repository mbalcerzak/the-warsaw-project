## Project Schema: Buying a Flat in Spain Using the Newest Technologies

### Introduction

1. **Overview of the Project**
   - Objective: To leverage modern technologies in the process of buying a flat in Spain.
   - Scope: Utilizing machine learning, cloud computing, and DevOps practices to streamline the property search, evaluation, and purchase processes.

2. **Relevance of Technologies**
   - Explanation of why incorporating these technologies is beneficial.
   - Current trends and advancements in real estate and tech integration.

### Step 1: Defining the Requirements

1. **Identify User Needs**
   - Location preferences (neighborhoods, proximity to my places of interest).
   - Budget constraints.
   - Specific requirements (size of the flat, amenities, terrace, elevator, etc.).

2. **Data Sources**
   - Real estate websites and databases ([Idealista.com](https://www.idealista.com/), Fotocasa, etc.).
   - Public data (crime rates, school quality, environmental factors).
   - Market trends and price analytics.

### Step 2: Data Collection and Preprocessing

1. **Web Scraping and APIs**
   - Tools: Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, Selenium.
   - Real estate APIs: Integrating with platforms providing property listings. I have been using Idealista API for the past year
   - Scraper set up on [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) using [Cron](https://crontab.guru/)
   - The script checks if the apartment is already present in the database and if yes, if the price has changed.

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handling missing values.
   - Normalizing data (consistent formats for prices, addresses, etc.).

3. **Data Storage**
   - Cloud database: MongoDB

### Step 3: Machine Learning Model Development

1. **Model Selection**
   - Types: Supervised learning for price prediction, unsupervised learning for clustering similar properties.
   - Algorithms: Linear Regression, Random Forest, K-Means Clustering.

2. **Model Training**
   - Dataset: Historical property prices, features (size, location, amenities).
   - Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn.

3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R-squared.
   - Cross-validation techniques.

### Step 4: Cloud Infrastructure and Deployment

1. **Cloud Providers**
   - AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, MongoDB

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Tools: Jenkins, CircleCI, GitLab CI.
   - Steps: Code integration, automated testing, continuous deployment.

3. **Containerization and Orchestration**
   - Docker: Containerizing the ML models and applications.
   - Kubernetes: Managing container deployment, scaling, and operations.

### Step 5: DevOps Practices

1. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
   - Tools: Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, Azure Resource Manager.
   - Automation of infrastructure setup and management.

2. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Tools: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).
   - Setting up alerts and dashboards for real-time monitoring.

3. **Security**
   - Practices: Encryption, Identity and Access Management (IAM), Secure APIs.
   - Tools: AWS IAM, Azure Security Center, Google Cloud Identity.

### Step 6: Showcasing the results

   - Frameworks: React, JavaScript, Docusaurus
   - Features: Property search filters, interactive maps, price predictions.
   - Hosting: Netlify

### Step 7: Testing and Feedback

1. **User Testing**
   - Beta testing with a group of users.
   - Collecting feedback for improvements.

2. **Iterative Improvement**
   - Implementing changes based on user feedback.
   - Continuous improvement cycle.

### Step 8: Final Deployment and Maintenance

1. **Deployment Strategy**
   - Phased rollout, blue-green deployment.

2. **Post-Deployment Monitoring**
   - Continuous monitoring of application performance and user feedback.

3. **Maintenance Plan**
   - Regular updates, bug fixes, and feature enhancements.

### Conclusion

1. **Summary of the Project**
   - Recap of the technologies used and their impact on the project.

2. **Future Directions**
   - Potential enhancements (e.g., integration of VR tours, blockchain for secure transactions).
