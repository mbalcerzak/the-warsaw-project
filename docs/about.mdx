## Business problem
---

The aim of this project is to build a model that would help me 
identify a good investment opportunity (overpriced or undervalued apartment in Warsaw). 
The model would predict a price given the data and indicate whether the actual price 
is too high or too low. 

## [Gathering the data](/Data/1_data_scraping.md)
---

#### Built with:
- [Python 3.9]('https://www.python.org/')
- [Scrapy]('https://scrapy.org/')

#### Database:
- [SQLite]('https://www.sqlite.org/index.html')

#### Output API:
- JSON hosted on [GitHub]('https://github.com/mbalcerzak/warsaw_flats_api/tree/raspberry-updates/json_dir')

#### Scraper:
- on [Raspberry Pi]('https://www.raspberrypi.org/')üçì on my fridge ü§´
- using [Cron]('https://crontab.guru/')
- from [gumtree.com](https://www.gumtree.pl/s-mieszkania-i-domy-sprzedam-i-kupie/warszawa/v1c9073l3200008p1)

#### Price changes
Apart from the ads I am also looking out for price changes. Some owners changed the price of the ad more 
than 5 times within 2 months period. I am curious to see if that additional information can be used in 
some way or if there is a way to predict whether the price of the apartment will change.


## Basic statistics
---
The average price for every month per every district of Warsaw and apartment "category size" is calulated and output as REST API.
Data is (was) updated daily. The last update was performed in February 2022 due to no new advertisements being 
published on gumtree after the Ukraine War started.

Aggregated statistics include:
- average price per square metre durign each month, per district per size category
- daily number of posted advertisements
- daily number of scraper advertisements
- number of price changes on a given day
