## 🎯 Project's objective {#objective}

 Looking for a nice flat with a terrace in Valencia. I want to be informed about the trends, 
 districts on the rise and know whether the apartment I like has any interesting price history.
 It's moslty a for-fun after-hours project to learn new MLOps tools and build something that works
